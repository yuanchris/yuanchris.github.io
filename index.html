			<h2>Intro</h2>
			<p>The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a men's professional basketball league in North America, composed of 30 teams (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada). </p>
			<p>It is one of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada, and is widely considered to be the premier men's professional basketball league in the world.</p>
			<p>The league was founded in New York City on June 6, 1946, as the Basketball Association of America (BAA). It changed its name to the National Basketball Association on August 3, 1949, after merging with the competing National Basketball League (NBL). </p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="secondary col">
			<h2>Teams</h2>
			<p>The NBA originated in 1946 with 11 teams, and through a sequence of team expansions, reductions, and relocations, currently consists of 30 teams. The United States is home to 29 teams; another is in Canada.</p>
			<p>The current league organization divides 30 teams into two conferences of three divisions with five teams each. The current divisional alignment was introduced in the 2004–05 season. Reflecting the population distribution of the United States and Canada as a whole, most teams are in the eastern half of the country: 13 teams are in the Eastern Time Zone, nine in the Central, three in the Mountain, and five in the Pacific.</p>

			<h2>The Top 3 Players in NBA History</h2>
			<p><strong>Michael Jordan: </strong>"MJ" accomplished everything possible in the game, piling up on the stats and awards. On the game's biggest stage—the NBA Finals—Jordan went a perfect 6-for-6, also sweeping Finals MVP in his appearances.</p>
			<p><strong>Wilt Chamberlain: </strong>Chamberlain's dominance is widely acknowledged, and as time passes he seems more and more like a mythical figure. In the 1961-62 regular season, he averaged 50.4 points and 25.7 rebounds. Simply unreal.</p>
			<p><strong>LeBron James: </strong>In a generation of prolific production, LeBron James stands apart as the best — and as one of the game’s all-time greats. You can stand in awe of his career stat line of 27.11 points (fourth all time), 7.4 rebounds and 7.3 assists per game, but James is one of those players whose advanced statistics are even more mind-boggling.</p>
